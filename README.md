The page will reload if you make edits.

This is an application with the role of helping people to program more easily at the dentist. Instead of calling every doctor/dental office just to check their 
schedule or maybe just to ask when could you make an appointment, now you can do all this and more online.

You can register either as a patient or a doctor. The information is saved using **MongoDB as a database.** The **password is hashed.** Every page has **access control** so only logged in users can do specific actions. A doctor will not have access to a patient page and a pacient will not have access to a doctor page.

As a patient you can make an appointment at a dental office or directly at a dentist. The patients **can leave a review for the doctors who treated them.**
Also they can see a doctor's profile or an office's profile.

Each office has a list with all of their doctors.

If a patient have questions, he/she can talk with a doctor **using the chat.** Also, if a doctor has some advices, he/she can send these through chat.

A doctor have a list with all of their "unresolved" appointments and after an appointment is done the dentist may decide to make a **recurring appointment** for the patient (for an monthly control)
The doctor can also edit his profile and chat with other patients.
